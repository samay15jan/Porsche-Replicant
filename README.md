* Sharpen my **UI/UX instincts** with Tailwind and styled-components
* Understand real-world app architecture and frontend performance

---

### 🚧 Challenges Faced

* Managed an enormous amount of **custom JSON data** for all car configurations
* Learned and integrated Redux from scratch to handle complex state logic
* Designed a fully responsive, aesthetic interface from the ground up
* Ensured performance and smooth UX despite heavy image/data rendering

This project took about **1.5 months of intense development** and **pushed my skills further than any tutorial ever could**.

* Optimized across major screen sizes and modern browsers

From cluelessness to clean code — this is one of the most satisfying builds I’ve ever completed.
